Path of Least Resistance Calculator
 - The purpose of this kata is to build a calculator that, given a grid of numbers, will return a path through those numbers with the least sum.

This was developed in XCode 7.3.1 using Swift and the project files are included.

To run the calculator, open the project in XCode. Build, test, and run in your preferred way. (cmd-b for build, cmd-u for test, cmd-r for run)
